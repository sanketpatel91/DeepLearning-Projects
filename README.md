#1. [Convolutional neural network - Image Classfication](https://github.com/sanketpatel91/DeepLearning-Projects/tree/main/Gender-Classification-Pytorch-Deep-Learning-CNN)

        The 2D convolution is a fairly simple operation at heart: you start with a kernel, which is simply a small matrix of weights.
        This kernel “slides” over the 2D input data, performing an elementwise multiplication with the part of the input it is currently on, and then summing up the results into a single output pixel.

        The dataset is of cropped images of male and female. It is split into training and validation directory. Training contains ~23,000 images of each class and the validation di
        rectory contains ~5,500 images of each class.
        Dataset is from Kaggle. Link => https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset
